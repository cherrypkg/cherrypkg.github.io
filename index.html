					<h1>Get Started</h1>

					<p>Getting started with Cherry is extremely simple.</p>

					<p>You'll want to begin by running <code>git clone https://github.com/cherrypkg/cherry</code> in a directory of your liking.</p>
					<p>Then, build Cherry by using the <code>prod.bat</code>, which is located in the <code>/build</code> folder. If you're not on Windows, you can still run the commands inside of the files &mdash; Red's CLI is system agnostic.</p>
					<p>The Red compiler will ask you if you want to build Cherry in dev or in prod. Simply type <code>prod</code> and press enter.</p>
